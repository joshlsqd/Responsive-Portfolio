				This is a paragraph about me (Joshua Cook). I was forced to write this at a "Boot Camp". They said it was for learning purposes but this I am fairly sure is a ruse. They say that learning HTML will benefit me and that I need it for a career but I have a feeling that later on they are going be saying something different.

				This "Boot Camp" is also at night so I am pretty sure that my family doesnt remember who I am. I think that may be ok in the long run. However, once this six months is complete the "instructors" have promised that we will be let free into the wild with all of our "knowledge". I look forward to that day.
